# Sorting-Visualizer

1) In the present work we tried to develop a Sorting Visualizer using the technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2) Sorting Visualizer will be displaying the working mechanism of various sorting algorithms like, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Merge Sort.
3) The main objective of developing this Visualizer is to make a learner comfortable in learning these techniques quickly and easily.
4) We know the sorting algorithms are the most widely used algorithms in many applications including Discrete event simulation, Operating Systems, real time systems and many other as well.
5) In the general case the efficiency of an application depends on the efficiency of sorting algorithm used.
6) The only limitation of the Sorting Visualizer is that we should have graphic cards in the general purpose computer.
7) Key-words: HTML, CSS, JS, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
